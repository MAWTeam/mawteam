                The MAW team is comprised of three individuals who have worked together since 2013: Matthew Sotoudeh, Adhiv Dhar, and William Shan. In the 8th grade we came together to build two projects: Planr and Classfinder. Planr was a task management application that rewarded users with points each time they completed a task. Our vision was that users could use these points to interact with a choose-your-own-adventure story and write their own. Unfortunately, our plans fell through due to a lack of available narratives. A little bit more of a success story, Classfinder, an application that allows students in-between grades to view and share their classes for the upcoming school year, has gone through 5 different redesigns and has cumulatively attracted over 1000 users. 
                <br/><br/>
                Since then, weâ€™ve taken the lessons learned from these past projects and pushed forward, attending hackathons and creating sites to solve problems at our school. The project that we are currently working on, Action, is a chrome extension that hopes to help student organizations manage their meetings and action items.
